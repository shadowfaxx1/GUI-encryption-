#  🛡️ TEXT ENCRYPTION 
> Automatic Carnival is a Python program that provides encryption and decryption functionality for text using a personalized key. With this program, you can convert normal text into a ciphered form using the provided key. Additionally, you can also decrypt the encrypted text back to its original form using the same key.

## Features
- Text Encryption: Automatic Carnival allows you to encrypt plain text using a personalized key. The encryption process converts the text into a ciphered form, making it unreadable to anyone without the key.

- Text Decryption: The program also supports the decryption of encrypted text. By providing the same key used for encryption, you can convert the ciphered text back to its original form.

- Personalized Key: You can choose a personalized key that suits your preferences or requirements. The key is an essential component for both encryption and decryption processes, ensuring the security and privacy of your text.

Modules Used
- Tkinter: Automatic Carnival utilizes the Tkinter module, which provides a simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). Tkinter allows for easy interaction with the program, making it more user-friendly.

- Base64: The Base64 module is employed to handle encoding and decoding operations. It converts binary data into ASCII characters, enabling the program to handle text-based encryption and decryption.

## Usage
1. Launch the Automatic Carnival program.

2. Enter the text you want to encrypt in the designated input field.

3. Provide your personalized key. The key can be any combination of characters, numbers, or symbols that you prefer.

4. Click on the "Encrypt" button to convert the text into an encrypted cipher.

5. To decrypt the encrypted text, enter the ciphered text in the input field.

6. Use the same key you used for encryption in the "Key" input field.

7. Click on the "Decrypt" button to convert the ciphered text back to its original form.

8. You can copy the encrypted or decrypted text from the output field for further use or analysis.
